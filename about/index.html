      <p>Hi! I'm readf0x, and this is my website! I'm a high school student in my junior year, but I actually first made this website when I was in the 8<sup>th</sup> grade. I let it sit in my github attic for half a year before I started working on it again... Anyways, I haven't made anything interesting besides this website really. I want to get into hardware and software engineering, but it's going to be hard to get into a field like that, especially since it requires so much work. I struggle with ADHD every day, it's near impossible to do something I don't want to do.<br><br>Enough of the sad stuff, let me tell you about The fun parts of my life! I've been playing minecraft since I was 6 or 7, but these days I play it off and on. Recently I haven't been playing video games at all really. I've spent my free time just watching youtube. Vargskelethor Joel and Vinny Vinesauce have made a comeback from my childhood recently. They never stopped streaming, I just stopped watching.<br><br>If you wanna contact me <strike>I'm usually available at <a href="mailto:readf0x@dublea.me">readf0x@dublea.me</a>.</strike> I no longer have constant access to that email, If you have to contact me, I'm more likely to respond on discord. There's a link to my server at the bottom of the page. If you're worried about too many notifications, don't worry, nobody uses it.</p>
